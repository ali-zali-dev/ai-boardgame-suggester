# Board Game RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

A modern, lightweight board game recommendation system powered by **LlamaIndex** RAG technology, using semantic search and AI-generated responses to help users find the perfect games.

## 🎉 **New in v2.0: LlamaIndex Migration**

**Major improvements:**
- ⚡ **95% smaller installation** (~500MB vs 7GB)
- 🚀 **10x faster installation** (30 seconds vs 5+ minutes)
- 🛠️ **Simplified architecture** using LlamaIndex framework
- 📦 **Lightweight embeddings** replacing heavy sentence-transformers
- 🎯 **Better performance** and easier maintenance

## 🎯 What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines the power of:
- **Semantic Search**: Finding relevant board games based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Vector Embeddings**: Converting game descriptions into numerical representations for similarity matching
- **Large Language Models**: Generating natural, conversational responses about game recommendations

## 🚀 Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions like "I want a strategic game for 2-4 players that takes about 90 minutes"
- **Semantic Search**: Finds games based on meaning and context, not just exact matches
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Get detailed, personalized recommendations with explanations
- **Rich Game Database**: Access to comprehensive BoardGameGeek dataset with 20,000+ games
- **Fast Vector Search**: LlamaIndex-powered similarity search for instant results
- **Lightweight Embeddings**: Efficient HuggingFace embeddings (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)
- **RESTful API**: Easy integration with web apps, mobile apps, or other services

## 📊 Dataset

Uses the BoardGameGeek (BGG) dataset (`bgg_dataset.csv`) containing:
- Game names, years, player counts, play times
- Ratings, complexity scores, BGG rankings
- Game mechanics (e.g., "Worker Placement", "Deck Building")
- Game categories (e.g., "Strategy Games", "Party Games")
- And more metadata for rich recommendations

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- **Gemini API Key** (recommended) OR **OpenAI API Key**  
- **Much faster installation**: Only ~500MB vs 7GB in previous version!

### Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   cd ai-boardgame-suggester
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (now much faster!):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # This now takes 30-60 seconds instead of 5+ minutes!
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API key
   ```

5. **Get your API Key**:
   
   **Option A: Google Gemini (Recommended - FREE!)**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key (free tier available)
   - Add it to your `.env` file:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
     LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
     ```
   
   **Option B: OpenAI**
   - Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Add it to your `.env` file:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
     LLM_PROVIDER=openai
     ```

6. **Test your setup** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python test_providers.py
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

### Option 1: Interactive Demo

Run the demo script to try example queries:

```bash
python demo_rag.py
```

This will:
- Initialize the RAG system with your game dataset
- Show example queries and responses
- Enter interactive mode for your own questions

### Option 2: API Server

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python main.py
```

The API will be available at:
- **API Base**: http://localhost:8000
- **Interactive Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

### API Endpoints

#### POST `/query` - Natural Language Queries
Ask questions in natural language and get AI-generated responses with game recommendations.

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "I want a cooperative game for beginners that takes less than 60 minutes",
  "num_results": 5
}
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "query": "I want a cooperative game for beginners...",
  "response": "Based on your criteria, I'd recommend these excellent cooperative games...",
  "games": [
    {
      "id": "game_123",
      "score": 0.85,
      "metadata": {
        "name": "Pandemic",
        "year": 2008,
        "min_players": 2,
        "max_players": 4,
        "play_time": 45,
        "rating": 7.6,
        "complexity": 2.4,
        "mechanics": "Cooperative Game, Hand Management...",
        "domains": "Strategy Games, Thematic Games"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "num_results": 5,
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  }
}
```

#### GET `/search` - Raw Similarity Search
Get similarity search results without AI-generated response.

**Example**: `GET /search?q=worker placement&limit=3`

#### GET `/stats` - Database Statistics
Get information about the game database.

#### GET `/health` - Health Check
Check if the RAG system is initialized and ready.

## 🧠 How It Works (LlamaIndex Architecture)

1. **Data Processing**: The system loads the BGG dataset and creates rich text descriptions for each game
2. **Document Creation**: Games are converted to LlamaIndex Document objects with metadata
3. **Lightweight Embeddings**: Uses efficient HuggingFace BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model (only ~100MB)
4. **Vector Indexing**: LlamaIndex creates and manages the vector index automatically
5. **Query Processing**: User queries are processed through LlamaIndex's query engine
6. **Response Generation**: Relevant games are sent to your LLM (Gemini or OpenAI) for natural responses

## 🎯 Example Queries

Try these natural language queries:

- "I want a strategic game for 2-4 players that takes about 90 minutes"
- "Show me cooperative games that are good for beginners"
- "What are the best party games for 6+ players?"
- "I need a quick game that takes less than 30 minutes"
- "Recommend some highly-rated euro games with medium complexity"
- "Find me games similar to Ticket to Ride"
- "What's a good gateway game for people new to board gaming?"

## 🔧 Technical Architecture (v2.0 - LlamaIndex)

- **RAG Framework**: LlamaIndex for streamlined RAG workflows
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async support
- **Vector Storage**: LlamaIndex's built-in vector store (replaces ChromaDB)
- **LLM Providers**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash OR OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (via LlamaIndex integrations)
- **Embeddings**: Lightweight HuggingFace BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (~100MB vs 7GB)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for CSV handling
- **API Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger docs

**Size Comparison:**
- **Previous**: ChromaDB + sentence-transformers = ~7GB
- **New**: LlamaIndex + lightweight embeddings = ~500MB
- **Reduction**: 93% smaller! 🎉

```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No LLM API key found"
Make sure you've set either `GEMINI_API_KEY` (for Gemini) or `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for OpenAI) in your `.env` file.

### "LLM provider not available"
Run `python test_providers.py` to check your API key configuration.

### "RAG system not initialized"
The system needs time to process the dataset on first startup. Check the health endpoint or console logs.

### "Embedding errors"
Delete the `embeddings_cache` folder and restart to recreate the embedding cache.

### "Import errors"
Make sure you've activated your virtual environment and installed all requirements.

## 💡 Advanced Usage

### Custom Queries
The system handles complex, multi-criteria queries:
- "Find a game like Azul but for more players"
- "I love Wingspan but want something with more player interaction"
- "Show me games with dice rolling that aren't too luck-based"

### Switching Providers
You can easily switch between LLM providers:

```bash
# Use Gemini (default and recommended)
echo "LLM_PROVIDER=gemini" >> .env

# Use OpenAI
echo "LLM_PROVIDER=openai" >> .env
```

### API Integration
Use the API in your applications:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/query", json={
    "query": "Strategic games for 2 players",
    "num_results": 3
})

result = response.json()
print(result["response"])
print(f"Using provider: {result['metadata']['provider']}")
```

## 📈 Performance (v2.0 Improvements)
